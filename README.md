ECListView
==============

A simple component to present a bulleted/numeric/custom list view with text indentation.

This project is about implementing text indentation in iOS.
("The placement of text farther to the right to separate it from surrounding text") 

I couldn't find an easy way to create a text list with indentation like the following example:

1. This is the first section.
2. This is the second one,
   with two lines and text indentation.
3. This is the third.

So I created a simple class to achieve this effect.
